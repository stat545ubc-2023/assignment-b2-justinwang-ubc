# GroupCount

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of GroupCount is to count missing values for all columns by group

## Installation

You can install the development version of GroupCount from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("stat545ubc-2023/groupCountMiss")
```

## Examples

This example computes the number of missing values in the `airquality` dataset grouped by the `cyl` column.

```{r}
library(GroupCount)
count_all_missing_by_group(airquality, Month)
```

This example has the same output as the last example, but shows off an alternative way of invoking the `count_all_missing_by_group()`: piping the dataset into the function.

```{r}
airquality |> count_all_missing_by_group(Month) 
```

The optional `.groups` argument allows us to keep the output grouped by the grouping column. See example below; notice how the output is a grouped tibble, rather than the ungrouped tibble output of the earlier examples.

```{r}
count_all_missing_by_group(airquality, Month, .groups = "keep")
```
